A very simple todolist inspired by https://github.com/Hypercubed/todo-md

It's pretty much just a todolist. 
I'm using githubs fancy pants todo's for future fun and profit.

Features:
 - [X] Add, delete, complete, reset and list items
 - [X] Pretty print with colors and stuff
 - [X] Add install script and configfile
 - [ ] Hide the sed backupfile
 - [ ] Push to gist/github
 - [ ] Pull changes from github
 - [ ] Add support for multiple lists
