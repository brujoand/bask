A very simple todolist inspired by https://github.com/Hypercubed/todo-md

It's pretty much just a todolist. 
I'm using githubs fancy pants todo's for future fun and profit.

The idea:
I have tried todoist, omnifocus, wunderlist, any.do and countless more todoapps. And I like most of them.
But they all require apps and most of them are paid. 
I don't need a fancy notification system, because I always ignore them.
I don't need fancy apps, because markdown works just fine.
I don't need deadlines, because calendars.

So this is a list. With a shellsciptwrapper. 
Maybe I'll add priorities and tags. But that's about it for "process features".

Features:
 - [X] Add, delete, complete, reset and list tasks
 - [X] Pretty print with colors and stuff
 - [X] Summary for each list
 - [X] Add install script and configfile
 - [ ] Add autocompletion
 - [ ] Hide the sed backupfile
 - [ ] Push to gist/github
 - [ ] Pull changes from github
 - [ ] Add support for multiple lists
 - [X] Allow moving tasks from inbox to some other list
 - [ ] Push Completed tasks to archivelist with timestamp
